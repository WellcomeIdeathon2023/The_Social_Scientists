```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```

## Importing data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tm)
twitter_data = read.csv("/Users/ssw107/Desktop/PhD/Wellcome Ideathon/EDA/The_Social_Scientists/data/vax_tweets.csv")

```

## Data types

```{r}
glimpse(twitter_data)

```


### Replace blanks with NA

```{r}
twitter_data[twitter_data == ''] <- NA
```

### Proportion missing for each variable

```{r}
colMeans(is.na(twitter_data))
```

seems some tweets have no user_followers and just afew are retweets. 6% have no user description

### User with multiple fields missing 

```{r}
twitter_data$na_count <- apply(twitter_data, 1, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

missing = subset(twitter_data,twitter_data$na_count>=8)

View(missing)
twitter_data = subset(twitter_data,twitter_data$na_count<8)
```

### Removing users with no followers

```{r}
twitter_data = subset(twitter_data,!is.na(twitter_data$user_followers))
```

```{r}
summary(twitter_data$user_followers)
```

Can exclude users below 1st quartile? no justification, maybe leave them..need to discuss


### Remove duplicate tweets and other things

```{r}
# Removing Duplicate tweets
twitter_data$Duplicate = duplicated(twitter_data$text)
twitter_data = subset(twitter_data, twitter_data$Duplicate=="FALSE")
twitter_data$Duplicate=NULL

twitter_data$text = gsub("[[:digit:]]", "", twitter_data$text) #numbers

twitter_data$text=gsub("[^\x01-\x7F]", "", twitter_data$text)

twitter_data$text = gsub("http\\w+", "", twitter_data$text) #links

```

                       ), collapse = '|')

twitter_data = twitter_data %>% filter(!grepl(remove.list, hashtags))

```

#### Trolling Tropes

                       ), collapse = ' ')
twitter_data = twitter_data %>% filter(!grepl(remove.list, text))

```

### Major news events


#### Date format

```{r}
twitter_data$date_new = as.Date(substr(twitter_data$date, 1, 10), format="%d/%m/%Y")

twitter_data$date_time=as.POSIXlt(twitter_data$date,format="%d/%m/%Y %H:%M")

twitter_data$day <- day(twitter_data$date_time)
twitter_data$hour <- hour(twitter_data$date_time)
```

#### Tweets by date

```{r}
ggplot(twitter_data, aes(x = date_new)) + 
  geom_density()
```
